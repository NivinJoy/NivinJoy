  <body>
    Hello! This is Nivin Joy and I am currently pursuing Btech in Artifical Intelligence and Data Science in my fifth semester.I am trying to expand my horizons in this field of engineering to the fullest.I did my entire schooling in Nirmala Matha Central School , Thrissur. I had pursued Biomaths in my Senior Secondary year as i was very much intrested in biology.Currently i am Nineteen years old and at the end of my teenage years.This website contains a breif information about me in general and the qualifications and achievements.

    career goals- I hope to generate my skillset required and the programming languages needed for the job recruitment. Be thorough with the basics and core and hope to join my dream company and dedicate my work to them.I was intrested in Biotechnology before joining for engineering , and decided i will use the engneering principles in that field after i complete my four year degree , that is what my passion has been.I am also intrested in the field of animations and in hopes of being a animator with the suitable drawing skills required for digital art and shading , which these skills are also needed in engineering and biology.


    personal intrests-It Usually revolves around designing , learning about game features ,  a bit of sports , drawing and crafting.But now slowly but gradually i have started to take a intrest in coding python as it is a easy programming language for beginners who start from scratch.I also look into gaming whenever i am free to understand how it works and admire the animation and vfx.
